ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .checkstyle
* .gitignore
* LICENSE.txt
* README.md
* lib\
* lib\android\
* lib\android\support_v4\
* lib\android\support_v4\22.0\
* lib\android\support_v4\22.0\support_v4-22.0.jar
* lib\obp\
* lib\obp\osmbonuspack\
* lib\obp\osmbonuspack\5.1\
* lib\obp\osmbonuspack\5.1\osmbonuspack-5.1.jar
* lib\osm3p\
* lib\osm3p\osmdroid-third-party\
* lib\osm3p\osmdroid-third-party\4.2\
* lib\osm3p\osmdroid-third-party\4.2\osmdroid-third-party-4.2.jar
* lib\tls\
* lib\tls\tls\
* lib\tls\tls\1.0\
* lib\tls\tls\1.0\tls-1.0.jar
* pom.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* lint.xml => app\lint.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
